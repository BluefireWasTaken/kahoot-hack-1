#What is it?
####tl;dr
It "hacks" [kahoot.it](https://kahoot.it) quiz platform

##Story
Basically during one boring quiz on kahoot, I came up with another funny name before it was instantly banned.
I went on google looking for a tool to flood the game with names like 1000 times so the teacher cannot ban them all. I found one tool on github but it was broken with the developer having no intent of fixing it.
So I thought why not build my own suite of tools for script kiddies to troll their teacher. And here we are.

If your not very technical, I am going to create a website version of these tools soon, so stay tuned!

#Tools
Here are the tools:

flood.py - Spam the game lobby with many names (e.g. 1000)

play.py - play kahoot normally

Soon to come - crash.py - crashing the game of kahoot so it cannot be played

#Prerequisites
